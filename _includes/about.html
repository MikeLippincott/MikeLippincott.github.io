        <p>My goal is to <b><u>bridge biology and computational science</u></b> to advance fundamental biological knowledge to <b><u>improve human health</u></b>. I am developing and applying innovative time-lapse microscopy and machine-learning techniques to enhance understanding of dynamic cell processes such as cell death. I aim to secure an NVIDIA fellowship to be exposed to cutting edge computer vision research which will increase my ability to model complex cell processes through time with Artificial Intelligence.</p>

I am doing this by enhancing the understanding of cell death mechanisms by developing and applying innovative microscopy and machine learning techniques. I aim to provide critical insights into genetic neuronal pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease by utilizing and developing systems biology approaches to <b><u>minimize human suffering.</u></b></p> -->
